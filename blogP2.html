    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Have you ever stressed so much in school that even sleeping feels exhausting? That was me. I was once a student who's day only revolves around school and sleep. Staring at school works, deadlines, and being absent minded all day. Once, I had a few hours of free time and I didn't want to lay down. I opened my laptop to take a short gaming break. <strong>What I didn't expect was how that short gaming break made me calm down, think more clearly, and boost my mood.</strong> That's when I realized that the "short gaming break" I took gave me a chance to be composed and relax amidst of all the chaos from school.
    </p>
    <h2>Gaming Is My Safe Space</h2>
    <p>
      When I get overwhelmed from amounts of school works, I open up my laptop to take a short gaming break. It gave me a space where I can breath from all the built-up stress from school. <strong>It's a place where I don't get judged, no expectations, and no pressure.</strong> I can fail, retry, and learn to grow without the consequences following me into real life. I made a few online friends that wait for me to get online so that we can talk while playing. It made me feel safe and comfortable.
    </p>
    <h2>Emotional Support in Digital Worlds</h2>
    <p>
        Gaming helped me emotionally. There were games that I played with good stories that hit me deep, characters I can relate to, and moments that made me think on how to improve my own life. There was a time where I played that made me rethink on how to view the world in another perspective. <strong>It changed me into a better and understanding person.</strong> Some games have lessons that affect me on how I live my life and I truly treasure those moments.
    </p>
    <h2>Balance, Not Addiction</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Gaming can be addictive at times</strong> but I learned that the best way to play is when it's balanced. I use it as a reward for myself everytime I finish a task or as a break when I need one. This helps me to stay motivated and look forward to my reward at the end of each task. It prevents me from having burnouts, and recharges my energy.
    </p>
    <h2>The Reasons Why I Love Gaming</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Relaxing</li>
      <li>Giving freedom to my creativity</li>
      <li>Socializing with other players</li>
      <li>Takes my mind away from the stress from school</li>
      <li>Boosts my mental health</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion/Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Gaming is not just a hobby for me, <strong>it supported me throughout the darkest days and helped me survive school.</strong> It helps me manage my stress, build my skills, and stay sane in some of my darkest days. To others, it may look like it's just another hobby, but to me, it's a safe place where I can express my true self. As long as I keep balance, <strong>gaming will always be more than a game, it's part of who I am and it keeps me going.</strong>

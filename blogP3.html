    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      &nbsp; I've been playing video games for as long as I can remember, and growing up, I slowly realized that games are not just about winning, graphics, or competition. I remember that there was a moment when I finished a game and just stared at the screen, I didn't know what to feel or to do. It wasn't because I lost or won but the story just hit me too hard and left a big impact on my heart. That moment made me realize that a game can not only entertain me but it can <strong>touch my heart so deeply</strong>. From then on, I started to dream about developing a simple game that can leave a everlasting impression on its players.
    </p>
    <h2>Why I want to Creat an Indie Game</h2>
    <p>
      &nbsp; The thing is, indie games feel more personal and close to me. They are the passion and hardwork of other people in order to entertain their players. They often tell stories that are raw, emotional, and relatable. I admire those developers that can turn personal experiences, struggles, and ideas into a small game that deeply connects with players. I want to create an indie game because it gives me <strong>creative freedom to tell a story that matters.</strong> My goal isn't just about gameplay mechanics.<strong> It's about the emotions.</strong> The loneliness, hope, fear, love, and growth. I want players to see part of themselves in the characters.
    </p>
    <h2>The Kind of Game I imagine</h2>
    <p>
    &nbsp; The indie game I dream of making would focus heavily on storytelling and atmosphere. A simple 2D 8-bit or minimalist 3D game with strong music, and meaningful dialogue would be my choice. I imagine a game where every choice matters. Multiple endings that gets affected by the players understanding of choices and story. Feeling every moment by slowing down, exploring, and just recieve all of the emotions from the game.<strong> I want the players to feel intimate by making the player feel that they also matter.</strong>
    </p>
    <h2> The Characteristics That I Want For My Game</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A simple 2D 8-bit or minimalist 3D art style</li>
      <li>Strong and emotional background music</li>
      <li>heart felt dialogue that reflects real emotions</li>
      <li>Choices that affect the story and lead to multiple endings</li>
      <li>A slow-paced experience that encourages exploration and reflection</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How This Project Reflects My Future Goals</h2>
    <p>
      &nbsp; This dream project reflects the kind of future I want in technology.<strong> I don't just want to create something that works, but I want to create something that connects with the users.</strong> Making an indie game would push me to improve my skills, creativity, and storytelling. It would also teach me patience, discipline, and how to turn my ideas into reality.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion/Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      &nbsp; My dream project is not about becoming popular or rich but leaving an everlasting impact on people. I want to create an indie game that touches hearts, tell a meaningful story, and stays with players long after they finish it. This dream motivates me to keep learning, improving, and believing in myself.<strong> Someday, I hope someone out there plays my game and feels understood.</strong> When that happens, I know that I achieved something.

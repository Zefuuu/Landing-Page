    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      &nbsp; Before I took Information Technology in college, I honestly tought it was just about computers, typing fast, writing codes, and maybe fixing the Wi-Fi when it breaks. I chose IT because I liked the screen of my uncle's computer which is always filled with codes and people say that it was "in demand", but I didn't fully understand what I was going for. Looking back at it now, there are so many things that I wish someone had told me earlier. If I had known these things before, I would've been more prepared to take on the challenges that IT had in it.
    </p>
    <h2>It's not Just About Computers</h2>
    <p>
      &nbsp; One important thing I wish I knew is that IT is that its not just about computers. It is more about understanding the system, solving its problems, and thinking logically. I often face situations where a small problem that I need to fix turns into a big problem and ending up redoing parts of the code. I learned that IT involves analyzing issues rather than just clicking buttons. This made me realize that IT is mentally challenging and always changing. If I had known this earlier, I would've prepared myself mentally for the challenges of critically thinking.
    </p>
    <h2>You Need to Be Willing to Self-Study</h2>
    <p>
    &nbsp; Another thing I wish I knew is how important self-studying is in IT. Not everything is fully explained in class, sometimes the lessons move very fast and I'm having a hard time taking it all in. I realized that relying only on lectures is not enough to survive in this course. I had to watch tutorials for some of the lessons, and practice on my own just to understand certain topics. At first, this felt overwhelming and tiring. Over time, I learned that self-studying is a crucial skill that as an IT student must learn and develop in order to succeed.
    </p>
    <h2>Time Management Really Matters</h2>
    <p>
      &nbsp; Time management is another thing that I underestimated before taking IT. IT projects, coding activities, and deadlines can quickly become overwhelming for me. I learned that cramming does not work well especially as someone who always procrastinate. As time pass by, I learned how to manage my time and start my assignments early which helped me avoid stress and mistakes. There were times when poor time management caused me unnecessary pressure and sleepless nights. If I had know how demanding IT workloads could be, I would have organized my time better from the start.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion/Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      &nbsp; Looking back, taking IT in college taught me many lessons that is beyond what I thought. I wish I knew earlier that it would challenge my patience, discipline, and mindset. Despite the struggles, this course helped me grow as a person. My biggest realization is that IT is not about knowing everything from the start, but about being willing to keep learning new things. If I continue to improve my skills and mindset, I believe that all of the challenges I faced and will face will be worth it. This experience has helped me prepare not only for a career in IT, but also in real life.
